# College-Soccer-Division-SQL-Database
CSC 4480 Final Project:
To run this application, download Oracle SQL Developer and import FinalProjectSchema.sql. From there, any existing tables with the same names will be dropped to create room for the new ones. Data for four separate example college soccer teams with 11 players each will be generated. Example queries can be seen for reference.
